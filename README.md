# Search Wikipedia Sentences with Jina

This is an example of using [Jina](http://www.jina.ai)'s neural search framework to search through a selection of individual Wikipedia sentences downloaded from Kaggle. It's based heavily on Jina's [South Park example](https://github.com/jina-ai/examples/tree/master/southpark-search).

## Index

`python app.py -t index -n 500`

Where `500` is the number of sentences you want to index

## Query

### With REST API

`python app.py -t query_restful`

### With gRPC

`python app.py -t query`
